## Overview

### :mount_fuji: The Challenge

Wanting to combine one of my interests, building custom mechanical keyboards, with my pursuit of learning new web technologies such as Vue.JS, Typescript and Cypress, I decided to take on the challenge of building a fully fledged web store with the most important core functionalities.

Customers can enjoy a minimalistic and responsive design on desktop and mobile devices, a simple e-commerce flow, a robust, refresh persistent shopping cart and fast loading times, due to client side form validation and optimized image content.

Shop owners can easily add new products through the products file. Subsequently, product category boxes, product pages, page routes and SEO metadata are created automatically and components styled dynamically.

"Happy" and "unhappy" customer purchase flows have E2E tests, the navbar has implementation tests and the cart some component tests to gain a small impression of Cypress's abilities.
